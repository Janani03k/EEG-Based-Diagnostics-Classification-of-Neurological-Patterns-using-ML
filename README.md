# Enhanced Epilepsy Diagnosis Using EEG Data and CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on improving epilepsy diagnosis by thoroughly examining EEG data using advanced data analysis techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We utilized two distinct datasets: the CHB-MIT EEG Database and the Bonn EEG Dataset, to develop a more accurate and automated method for epilepsy diagnosis.

## Objectives
- To conduct a detailed analysis of EEG data for epilepsy diagnosis.
- To compare the efficacy of frequency domain signals against time domain signals in classifying epileptic patterns.
- To leverage CNN for higher accuracy in EEG data interpretation.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: Prepared and processed EEG data from both datasets for analysis.
- **CNN Implementation**: Utilized CNNs to analyze high-dimensional EEG data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed the effectiveness of the models in identifying epileptic patterns.

## Key Findings
- Frequency domain signals were found to be more accurate in classifying epileptic patterns compared to time domain signals.
- The CNN model proved highly effective in recognizing complex patterns in EEG data, supporting a shift towards more data-driven and automated epilepsy diagnosis methods.

## Conclusion
This project marks a significant advancement in the field of neurological disorder diagnosis. By harnessing the power of CNN and detailed EEG data analysis, we have opened new possibilities for accurate, efficient, and automated epilepsy diagnosis, contributing to the broader medical and scientific community's understanding of neurological disorders.
